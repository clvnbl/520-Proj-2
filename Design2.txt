	we used the repo from ryan tim wilson for insperation for all of the code used. Here is the link to his repo
	https://github.com/ryantimwilson/Pintos-Project-2

Data structures for both (Decide which is for argument and which is for user programs)!!!!!!

process.c
char *save_ptr and file_name in process_execute() used to get the parsed file name and store both its name and pointer
char *save_ptr and file_name in start_process() used to get the actual file name from first parsed token and store name and pointer
WORD_SIZE constant set to 4 used in the setup_stack function 
DEFAULT_ARGV set to 2 used in the setup_stack function
token set to *esp used to push argv then decrement the *esp pointer

Syscall.c
MAX_ARGS constant set to 3 
USER_VADDR_BOTTOM set to ((void *) 0x08048000)
struct process_file used to hold a file pointer, int fd, and a list_elem struct 

thread.c

t-> parent = thread_tid() added in thread_create() used to hold the parent of the current thread
struct child_process used to hold the struct value of the child process from the parent

	process_execute
		save_ptr and file_name - used to get the parsed file name and store both its name and pointer
		
	start_process
		save_ptr and file_name - used to get the parsed file name and store both its name and pointer
		thread_current()->cp->load - a value will be set to load that will signify if a load is successful or a failure
		
	process_wait
		struct child_process* child_p - this is a new struct of a child process set to the child process with the child_tid that was brought into the method values will be modified
		
	process_exit
		no new structs created, only used the existing struct
		
	
		



---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?
	When we run the setup_stack() method it will call the additional function setup_stack_helper() which will then
	call strtok_r. Then all of the token inputs are put into an array and the argc is incremented. These tokens are
	pushed onto the stack along with the pointer starting at argc-1 and going to 0. The input is also limited so that 
	the stack can not be overflowed. 


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?
	strtok_r can be called from multiple threads without causing undefined behavior 
	and also parse multiple strings at once

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into an executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.
	With the Unix approach less unnecessary work is done in the kernel, and does 
	better at error handling at user level

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the

	We take the list of arguments and make sure that the buffer is not invalid. Then the pointer to the file is 
	taken in. We then make sure that file descriptor points to the valid file and checks that permissions are right. 
	It then  obtains a lock, and writes to the file assuming that all the checks passed.

	If the size of data is all contained in one page then it would call pagedir_get_page once, but if it is covering
	two pages it will have to call pagedir_get_page twice. There isn't much room for improvement because a call of
	2 bytes has the same result as 4096 bytes.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

	Wait looks at list of child processes and will use locks and semaphores to wait for children to finish until 
	none are needing to be waited on. Process termination will go through the children and set whether to wait 
	or not.

	Each function and all levels are responsible for the resources they control. This way if there is an error
	within the function it can make sure everything gets cleaned up, clean all resources and return the error
	code so functions above it can repeat the process. This way if an error could happen to other programs it will
	be handled.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed

>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?
		
	The exec system call needs a new child process made and then it will attempt to load the new process.
	If successful set the load_status variable to true 0 or false -1. After return we load status of the struct.

	Creating a process adds C to a child process of P and P to a parent list of C.
	This makes sure that if the child runs and completes the parent knows that it is terminated
	and does not have to wait, but if not it knows it does need to wait
	If the parent terminates before child. the parent pointer on child will be set to null
	Both of these ensure race conditions will not do anything bad.
